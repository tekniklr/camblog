Get pictures from your phone to your website using the height of 2004 
technology!

I've replaced this system with twitter/instagram/etc so don't use it 
anymore but am providing it for archival/informational purposes.


FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * simple_version.pl: the original version written in 2004.
  * camblog.pl: the version I was using up to the time when I decided I'd 
    be better off with Instagram
  * camblog.php: the companion file that reads the image index generated 
    by one of the above perl scripts and serves the images on your website


REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------
  * A cellphone that can take pictures and send them to an email address.
  * A web host that provides local mail and procmail capabilities.
  * CPAN modules for the basic version:
      MIME::Parser
      Date::Manip
  * CPAN modules for the more complex twitter/flickr/url shortening 
    version:
      MIME::Parser
      Date::Manip
      Getopt::Long
      Net::Twitter
      WWW::Shorten::Bitly
      WWW::Shorten::isgd
      HTML::Strip
      Flickr::Upload


CONFIGURATION (simple_version.pl)

  1. Add this to your .procmailrc:

  2. Edit the basic configuration at the top of simple_version.pl
  3. Use camblog.php as a general guide. It's highly customized to the way 
     my site was set up while I was using this system.
